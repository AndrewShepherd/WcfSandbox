            The goal is to create secure two-way communication using NetTcpBinding.
        </p>
        <p>This will involve having a private key on the server, and a public key on the client</p>
        <p>The steps, as I remember, as as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure we have a root certification authority set up.</li>
            <li>Ensure that a revocation list is installed for this authority</li>
            <li>Create a certificate that is signed by this root certificate authority, and load it into the certificate store</li>

            <li>Tell the server to use it</li>
            <li>Tell the client to expect it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm not sure how this will work using two-way NetTcpBinding</p>
        <p>To demonstrate this, we will use a Chatroom application</p>
